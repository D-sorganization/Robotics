README: Evaluating Form Closure Project

This submission contains:

1. MATLAB function "IsInFormClosure.m" in the "code" directory.
   - This function determines whether a given set of planar contact wrenches result in form closure.
   - Includes an example in comments.

2. Two test cases in the "results" directory:
   - log_case1.txt: textbook example that is in form closure.
   - log_case2.txt: underactuated 2-contact case, not in form closure.
   - case1_form_closure.png: visualization of contact normals and COR regions for Case 1.
   - case2_not_form_closure.png: visualization for Case 2.

All COR regions were plotted based on the geometric interpretation of feasible twist directions as in Chapter 12.1.
