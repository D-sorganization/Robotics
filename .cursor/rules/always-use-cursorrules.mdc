Always respect the guidelines contained in .cursorrules.md file in the main directory.

## Key Principles:
1. **NEVER work on main branch** - always create feature branches
2. **NEVER use placeholders** - implement complete, working code
3. **NEVER skip verification** - run all quality checks before claiming completion
4. **ALWAYS cite sources** for constants and scientific values
5. **ALWAYS include tests** for both valid and invalid inputs
6. **ALWAYS show proof** with full command output

## When in doubt:
- Check .cursorrules.md for specific requirements
- Follow the workflow: Branch → Plan → Execute → Verify → Document
- If blocked, explain exactly why and what's needed to proceed
