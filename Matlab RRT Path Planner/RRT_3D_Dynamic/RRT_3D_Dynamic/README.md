# Star Wars RRT Path Planner - Enhanced Version

## üöÄ Overview

This enhanced version of the Star Wars RRT Path Planner transforms the basic path planning system into a comprehensive, cinematic Star Wars-style pursuit and navigation simulator. The system now features proper ship orientation, intelligent pursuit AI, multiple camera views, and a full GUI interface.

## ‚ú® Key Improvements

### 1. **Proper STL Loading and Ship Orientation**
- **Fixed STL Loading**: Added robust `stlread.m` function that handles both ASCII and binary STL files
- **Nose-Forward Movement**: Ships now properly orient with their nose facing the direction of travel
- **Smooth Rotations**: Implemented `shipOrientation.m` for realistic ship movement
- **Fallback Models**: Simple geometric ships when STL files are unavailable

### 2. **Intelligent Pursuit System**
- **Dual Ship Scenarios**: Two ships can now engage in pursuit/evasion
- **AI Behavior**: Target ship intelligently evades when pursued, moves toward goals when safe
- **Dynamic Path Planning**: Pursuer continuously replans path to intercept target
- **Capture Detection**: System detects when ships get close enough for "capture"

### 3. **Comprehensive GUI Interface**
- **User-Friendly Controls**: Intuitive panel-based interface
- **Mode Selection**: Switch between single ship navigation and pursuit mode
- **Camera Control**: Multiple preset views (Cinematic, Chase Cam, Top Down, Side View, Free Camera)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live updates as paths are planned and animated
- **Environment Customization**: Load custom obstacles or generate random ones

### 4. **Enhanced Visual Effects**
- **Cinematic Starfield**: Dynamic starfield with varying star sizes and colors
- **Path Traces**: Ships leave colored trails showing their movement history
- **Laser Effects**: Optional laser shots during pursuit scenarios
- **Capture Effects**: Visual feedback when ships capture targets
- **Dynamic Camera**: Camera follows ships and adjusts based on pursuit dynamics

### 5. **Improved Path Planning**
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Paths are smoothed for more realistic movement
- **Enhanced RRT**: Improved goal biasing and collision detection
- **Multiple Obstacle Types**: Support for both spherical and cubic obstacles
- **Boundary Constraints**: Ships stay within defined environment bounds

## üéÆ Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Run `main_improved.m` in MATLAB
2. The system will attempt to launch the GUI
3. If GUI is unavailable, it will fall back to command-line mode

### GUI Mode
1. **Mode Selection**: Choose between "Single Ship Navigation" or "Pursuit Mode"
2. **Ship Configuration**: Select different ships for pursuer and target
3. **Camera Views**: Choose from multiple cinematic camera angles
4. **Environment Setup**: Set start/goal positions or load custom obstacles
5. **Animation Control**: Adjust speed and visualization options
6. **Plan & Animate**: Click "Plan Path" then "Animate" to see the action

### Command-Line Mode
1. Select mode (1 for single ship, 2 for pursuit)
2. Choose visualization type
3. Watch the cinematic animation
